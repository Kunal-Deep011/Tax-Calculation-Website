Simple TAX CALCULATION WEBSITE built with Javascript, HTML, CSS to help user to evalute their salary.

In this website, User have to give his/her annual gross income, extra income, deductions money and their age and after submiting the details it shows your overall income after the tax deductions.

1) The tax calculation works based on this formula -
    - Overall income (after deductions) under 8 (≤) Lakhs is not taxed.
        - Ex - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  6 Lakhs, no tax
        - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  9 Lakhs, tax
2) Income over 8 (>) Lakhs, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at
        - 30% for people with age < 40
        - 40% for people with age ≥ 40 but < 60
        - 10% for people with age ≥ 60
        - Example
            - Age = 34, Income = 40 Lakhs, no deductions, tax = .3 * (40 - 8) = .3 * 32 = 9.6 Lakhs
